Morrslieb, the evil moon, shines down over the walls of the slumbering castle. A lone creak resounds through the air as the front gates are drawn open. Suddenly, screams fill the night as the hordes of Chaos rampage through the city. Huge red daemons brandishing massive hellblades tear through the streets cutting down everyone they find in the name of Khorne. As the daemons reach the inner gate, they are beset by a massive vulture-headed creature! The minions of the two rival powers clash in the streets, stomping helpless peasants underfoot. The count sends his mightiest knights forth to do combat with the forces of Chaos, but they are no match for the daemons arrayed against him. The city will fall, but which power will claim it?
